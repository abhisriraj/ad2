                         ABSTRACT
The level of pollution has increased with times by lot of factors like the increase in population, increased
vehicle use, industrialization and urbanization which results in harmful effects on human well by directly
affecting health of population exposed to it. In order to monitor in this project we are going to make an” IOT
Based Air Pollution Monitoring System” in which we will monitor the Air Quality over a web server using
internet and will trigger a alarm.
When the air quality goes down beyond a certain level, means when there are sufficient amount of harmful
gases are present in the air like CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene and NH3. It will show the air quality in PPM
on the LCD and as well as on web page so that we can monitor it very easily. In this IOT project, you can
monitor the pollution levelfrom anywhere using your computer or mobile. System is designed, implemented
and tested to monitor the pinpoints of air pollution of any area.
It consists of a micro controller, gas sensors, mobile unit, a temporary memory buffer and a web server with
internet connectivity which collects data from different locations along with coordinate’s information at
certain time of a day. The readings for particular locationare averaged in a closed time and space.
The Global Positioning System (GPS) module is attached to a system toprovide accurate representation of
pollution sources in an area. The recorded data is periodically transferred to a computer through a General
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) connection and then the data willbe displayed on the dedicated website with
user acceptance. As a result large number of people
